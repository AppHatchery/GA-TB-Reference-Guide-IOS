        Dear Clinician: <br><br>
        <span class="uk-paragraph" style="padding-left: 15px;">
             The Georgia TB Reference Guide responds to clinicians’ questions about tuberculosis infection, disease, and prevention and control. The standards and guidelines are based on the work and recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), Emory University, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Guide also provides guidance from the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) TB Program and contact information for District TB Coordinators. This updated edition of the Guide contains updated recommendations on the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) and treatment of active TB disease and an updated format inspired by users of the Guide app.
         </span>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        The treatment of a person with TB always requires a clinician to exercise clinical and professional judgment. These guidelines provide a framework for the diagnosis and treatment of persons with TB infection or active TB disease.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">This is not an exhaustive review of the subjects covered. It is an accessible reference guide which provides guidance for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB. Since guidelines for treating, preventing, and controlling TB continue to evolve, it is appropriate for clinicians to check further for new treatment regimens.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        The Georgia TB Reference Guide app was redesigned and extensively updated in 2025 based on user feedback and new developments in the field of TB.
    </p>
    <h4>Detailed information is available from: </h4>
