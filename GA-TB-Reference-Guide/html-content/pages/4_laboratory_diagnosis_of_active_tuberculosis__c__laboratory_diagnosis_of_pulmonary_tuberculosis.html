        <p class="uk-paragraph">Immunocompromised patients are less likely to have typical CXR findings (i.e., upper lobe infiltrates which may cavitate). <b>A normal CXR does not rule out active pulmonary TB,</b> especially in a person living with HIV.</b></p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            A minimum of two AFB smears is generally recommended for persons with presumed pulmonary TB. The overall sensitivity of AFB smear for pulmonary TB is 50% to 70%, and the sensitivity is reduced among immunosuppressed and pediatric patients.
        </p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">First morning sputum specimens have increased sensitivity
            and at least one first morning specimen should be obtained.</p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">The sensitivity of ATS/IDSA/CDC endorsed NAATs for
            smear-negative and smear-positive TB are approximately
            67% and 96% respectively. <b>A negative NAAT performed on a
                smear-negative sample does not rule out TB,</b> whereas a
            negative NAAT performed on a smear-positive sample usually indicates presence of non-tuberculous
            mycobacteria.</p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            For persons with presumed pulmonary TB who are unable to produce good quality sputum (defined as > 3 ml of sputum), consider obtaining induced sputum sample (using 3% NaCl aerosol) for smear, culture, and NAAT samples.

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            Children are more likely to have paucibacillary disease and are often unable to produce good quality 
            sputum specimens. However, clinicians should pursue microbiological TB diagnosis when feasible. Stool 
            for AFB culture and gastric aspirate when appropriately performed has a yield of > 50%. Instruct 
            patients to fast overnight prior to having the gastric aspirate performed. Commensal non-tuberculous 
            mycobacteria are present in the GI tract and a positive AFB smear of a gastric aspirate should be 
            interpreted with caution. <a href="(https://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/products/view/pediatric-tuberculosis-guide-gastric-aspirate-ga-procedure).">(https://www.currytbcenter.ucsf.edu/products/view/pediatric-tuberculosis-guide-gastric-aspirate-ga-procedure).</a>
