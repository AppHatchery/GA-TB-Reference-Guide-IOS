   <p>** EXCEPTION: tuberculous meningitis. To avoid life-threatening CNS immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), persons living with HIV and tuberculous meningitis should not be started on ART until AFTER the TB meningitis is under control and at least two weeks anti-TB treatment</p>
    <p>
        <b>PREVENTING IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome)</b>: prednisone 40 mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 20 mg/day for 2 weeks is recommended for people with CD4 100 cells/mm3 who start ART within 30 days of TB treatment, are responding well to treatment, do not have known or suspected rifampin resistance, Kaposi sarcoma, or active hepatitis B. This recommendation does not apply to people with CNS TB for whom steroids are recommended from the time TB treatment is started.
