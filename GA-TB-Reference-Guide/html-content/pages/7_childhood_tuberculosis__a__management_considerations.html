        <li>TB disease in infants and children younger than 4 years of age is much more likely to disseminate;
            therefore,
            prompt evaluation and treatment should be started when the diagnosis is suspected.
        </li>
        <li>Performing Mycobacterial culture, smear and nucleic acid antigen tests from respiratory 
            specimens of children with suspected pulmonary TB is generally recommended, particularly 
            when the source patient is unknown or there is concern for drug-resistant TB. Acceptable
             specimens include induced sputa or early morning gastric aspirates on 3 consecutive days
              for children who cannot produce sputa. . In certain situations, bronchoalveolar lavage or 
              tissue biopsy may be considered. If the adult source case is known, it may be reasonable to 
              rely on the results of susceptibility tests of specimens from the adult source case to guide
               the pediatric treatment regimen, particularly if the child is well, the sole reason for 
               evaluation is contact investigation, and obtaining pediatric specimens is technically challenging or burdensome.
        </li>
        <img src="../assets//image_2.png">
        <li>Children 3 months-15 years of age with non-severe pulmonary TB (including intrathoracic TB) should receive an empiric
             regimen of four drugs (INH, RIF, PZA, EMB) for 2 months and RIF and INH for the remaining 2 months when
              drug resistance is not suspected (4 months total). A three-drug regimen (INH, RIF, PZA) can be used as empiric
               therapy when the isolate (i.e. from source TB case) is known to be fully drug susceptible. Non-severe pulmonary 
               TB is defined as AFB smear-negative disease with the following radiographic features: uncomplicated hilar
                adenopathy without evidence of airway obstruction, disease confined to less than one whole lobe, without complex pleural effusion, miliary pattern, or cavitary lesion.
        </li>
        <li>
            Children who are severely ill, have a history of prematurity <37 weeks, are <3 months or >/=16 years of age, are
            pregnant, who have underlying disease that could complicate interpretation of the response to TB therapy, or 
            who have a contraindication to any first line TB medication are not currently candidates for a 4- month treatment regimen.
        </li>
        <li>
            Children with severe pulmonary TB, or who otherwise do not meet criteria for non-severe disease treatment, should receive an additional 2 months of RIF and INH, for a minimum duration of 6 months of therapy. Children and adolescents with “adult-type” tuberculosis consisting of cavitation and AFB positive sputum samples should receive a 4-drug regimen initially until susceptibility is proven. The persistence of cavitary lesions and/or a positive sputum culture after 2 months of effective therapy may warrant extension to a 9-month course of therapy.        
        </li>
        <li>In general, non-CNS extrapulmonary TB can be treated with the same regimen as pulmonary TB (i.e. 4- 6 months for drug-susceptible disease). Drug-susceptible peripheral lymph node TB is considered non-severe and can be treated for 4 months. All other disease forms should be treated for a minimum of 6 months.
        </li>
        <li>Children with TB meningitis should receive 12 months of therapy.When clinical or epidemiologic circumstances suggest an increased probability of INH resistance, EMB can be used safely at a dose of 15—20 mg/kg per day as a fourth drug, even in children too young for routinevisual testing. Ethionamide should be used instead of ethambutol in cases of TB meningitis. Streptomycin, kanamycin or amikacin can be used as alternatives, if necessary, though should generally be avoided based on their significant toxicity profile. Directly observed therapy is the standard of care for all children.
        </li>
        <li>
            HIV testing should be performed on all individuals with TB disease (including children) as the treatment regimen (including need for antiretroviral therapy) may need to be altered in people with HIV infection.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clinical and radiographic examinations may be monitored for response to therapy. However, resolution of abnormal findings on chest radiography with pulmonary or intrathoracic lymphadenopathy may lag behind clinical response. Chest radiography is usually not performed at the conclusion of a successful course of treatment and should not be used as a criterion for discontinuing anti-TB drugs.
        </li>
        <li>Management of the newborn infant whose mother or other caregiver is suspected of having TB is based on
            individual considerations. Separation of the mother (or caregiver) and infant should be minimized, if
            possible. </li>

                <li><i><b>Mother
                    or other caregiver who has a positive tuberculin skin test or IGRA and normal chest radiography.</b></i>
                    If,
                    after investigation, no evidence of active TB disease is found in the mother or caregiver to whom
                    the infant is
                    exposed, separation of mother or caregiver and infant is not indicated. These mothers may breastfeed
                    their
                    infants. Evaluation of all contacts should be performed to attempt to identify a source case.

                <li><i><b>Mother or other caregiver who has abnormal chest radiography suggestive of tuberculosis
                    disease but is judged to be noninfectious at delivery. </b></i>The situation in which a mother or
                    caregiver’s
                    history, physical examination, and sputa examination do not suggest active disease may be considered
                    to be a low
                    risk exposure and the separation of mother/ caregiver and the infant is not necessary. The
                    mother/caregiver
                    should receive therapy and contacts should be evaluated with a TST or IGRA to attempt to identify a
                    source
                    case. The infant should be followed closely by a pediatric provider.
                </li>
                <li><i><b>Mother who has active TB disease and is suspected of being infectious at the time of
                    delivery.</b></i>The infant should be assessed for evidence of congenital tuberculosis and the
                    mother/caregiver should be evaluated for HIV infection. A healthcare provider with expertise in the
                    treatment of infants with
                    congenital tuberculosis should be consulted to assist with management of the infant’s anti-TB
                    regimen. If congenital tuberculosis is not suspected, the infant
                    should receive INH (10 mg/kg/ dose) daily until the infant is 3 – 4 months of age when a TST should
                    be placed.
                    If the TST result is reactive, an evaluation for tuberculosis disease should be conducted. If TB
                    disease is
                    excluded, the infant should continue to receive INH until 9 months of age with monthly assessments
                    to complete
                    treatment for LTBI. If the TST at 3–4 months of age is nonreactive and the mother/ caregiver’s
                    adherence to
                    therapy can be documented and is no longer infectious, the infant’s INH may be discontinued.
