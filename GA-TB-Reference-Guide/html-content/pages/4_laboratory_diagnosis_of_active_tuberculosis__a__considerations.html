            Active TB diagnosis is usually pursued by mycobacterial acid -fast bacilli smear (“AFB smear”), mycobacterial culture (“AFB culture”), nucleic acid amplification tests, radiological exam, and histopathology.
        </p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            Phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing is optimal for patient care and genotyping is paramount for tuberculosis control. Both tests require an isolate from a positive culture. Thus, adequate samples for mycobacterial culture should be obtained whenever possible.
        </p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            Diagnostic samples can be collected after TB treatment initiation among patients with life-threatening disease or other compelling indications for immediate TB treatment (Figure 1).
        </p>

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            TST and/or IGRA are negative in 10-30% of patients with active TB. Thus, a negative TST and/or IGRA do not rule out active TB.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            The sensitivity of each test (smear, culture, and nucleic acid amplification) differs by sample source (e.g., sputum vs. cerebrospinal fluid).
        </p>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines for Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Adults and Children are a comprehensive source for laboratory tests for TB diagnosis [Lewinsohn et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2017].
