        <ul>
            <li>a single positive IGRA or TST result should not be taken as reliable evidence of M. tuberculosis infection.</li>
            <li>Because of the low probability of infection, a false-positive result is more likely. In such situations, the likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection and of disease progression should be reassessed, and the initial test results should be confirmed.</li>
            <li>Repeat testing, with either the initial test or a different test, may be considered on a case-by-case basis. For such persons, an alternative is to assume, without additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive. This becomes somewhat complex because of the lack of a “gold standard” diagnostic test for LTBI.</li>
            <li>For healthy persons who have a low risk for both infection and progression, discounting an isolated positive result as a false positive may be reasonable. This will increase detection specificity and decrease unnecessary treatment.</li>

    <div class="item">
        <ul>
            <li>decisions about medical or public health management require individualized judgment in assessing the quality and magnitude of each test result (e.g., size of induration and presence of blistering for a TST; and the TB Response, Nil, and Mitogen values for an IGRA), the probability of infection, the risk for disease if infected, and the risk for a poor
                outcome if disease occurs.</li>
            <li>Patients who are at high risk for progression to active TB disease when LTBI is present (e.g., persons living with HIV, those scheduled to begin a TNF-α inhibitor, children < 5 years) should be assumed to have LTBI if one diagnostic test is positive (even if there are discordant results).</li>
            <li>For persons who have received BCG and who are not at increased risk for a poor outcome if infected, TST reactions of < 15 mm in size may reasonably be discounted as false positives when an IGRA is negative.</li>
            <li>In other situations, inadequate evidence exists on which to base recommendations for dealing with discordant results. Consultation with a TB expert should be considered when discordant results are present.</li>
