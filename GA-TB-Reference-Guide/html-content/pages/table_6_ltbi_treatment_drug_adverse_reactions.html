        <i>* Hypersensitivity reaction to rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine): reactions may include a flu-like syndrome (e.g. fever, chills, headaches, dizziness, musculoskeletal pain), thrombocytopenia, shortness of breath or other signs and symptoms including wheezing, acute bronchospasm, urticaria, petechiae, purpura, pruritus, conjunctivitis, angioedema, hypotension or shock. If moderate to severe reaction (e.g. thrombocytopenia, hypotension), hospitalization or life-threatening event: Discontinue treatment. If mild reaction (e.g. rash, dizziness, fever): Continue to monitor patient closely with a low threshold for discontinuing treatment. A flu-like syndrome appears to be the most common side effect profile leading to discontinuation of the 3HP regimen. Rifabutin can rarely cause uveitis.</i>
