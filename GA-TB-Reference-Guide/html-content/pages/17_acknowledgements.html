        The <i>Georgia TB Reference Guide</i> was initially adapted from <i>Tuberculosis at a Glance, A Reference Guide for Practitioners Covering the Basic Elements of Tuberculosis Care</i>, designed and produced by the New York City Department of Health, Bureau of Tuberculosis Control.
    </p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        Multiple updates to print copies were subsequently made and in 2022, we transitioned to a mobile app through collaboration with the Georgia CTSA appHatchery. The Georgia TB Reference Guide app was redesigned and extensively updated in 2025 based on user feedback and new developments in the field of TB. Many thanks to appHatchery members Santiago Arconada Alvarez, Morgan Greenleaf, Jingying Yao, Wilbur Lam, Upasana Bhattacharjee, Maxwell Jr Kapezi, Naomi Nyama, Wiza Munthali, Kennedy Linzie, Hope Madziakapita, Kelvin Sande, and Mabuchi Nyirenda.

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        In addition to the Guide app users who have provided valuable feedback, we extend a special thanks to Andi Shane, MD, MPH, MSc, and Collin Dubick, MD, in the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Emory University for updating the childhood tuberculosis section; Kyleigh Marshall, MPH for editorial assistance; and to the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) TB Program including Benjamin Yarn, Andrea (Lynn) Latham, and Kayleigh Nerhood for their ongoing and unwavering support and collaboration.
