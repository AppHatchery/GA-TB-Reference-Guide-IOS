    <p class="uk-paragraph">The basic
        principles for treatment of TB disease and infection in children and adolescents are similar to adults. The
        objective of treatment is to kill the tuberculous bacilli in the shortest amount of time while preventing the
        development of resistance. Dosage adjustments of medications may often be required based on weight. When
        possible, crushed tablets or the mixed contents of capsules are preferred over suspensions that may be difficult
        to access and may contain fewer desirable additives.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">Either TST
        or immunologic-based testing (IGRAs) may be used to aid in LTBI or TB disease diagnosis in immune competent
        children age 2 years or older. For children under 2 years of age, TST is preferred; however, if the child has
        a negative TST but is at high risk for TB disease or LTBI, then an IGRA may be performed. The involvement of a
        provider with expertise in management of children with tuberculosis infection or disease is beneficial in
        guiding diagnostic evaluation and treatment.</p>
