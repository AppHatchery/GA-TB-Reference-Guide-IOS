                As its use along with appropriate antituberculosis drugs is associated with a lower mortality.
            </li>
            <li>
                For patients with tuberculous meningitis, dexamethasone or prednisolone is recommended as adjunct therapy for a total of 6 to 8 weeks. An initial dose of 8 mg per day of dexamethasone for children < 25 kg and 12 mg per day for children > 25 kg and adults can be used. The initial dose is given for 3 weeks and then the dose should be tapered during the following 3 weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Adjunctive corticosteroids in treatment of pericardial tuberculosis did not reduce mortality, tamponade or constrictive physiology in a large randomized clinical trial and are thus no longer routinely recommended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some experts would use corticosteroids in selected patients with TB pericarditis: those with large effusions and/or high levels of inflammation in pericardial fluid.
