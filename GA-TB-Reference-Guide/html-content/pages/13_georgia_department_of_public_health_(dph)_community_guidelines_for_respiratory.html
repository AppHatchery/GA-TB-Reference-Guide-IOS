        In setting guidelines, the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) follows CDC recommendations that a stepwise approach be used to seek the least intrusive policy that is consistent with maintaining the health of the community.
    </p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">These guidelines provide a framework for clinical management of patients with TB. The management of each patient must be customized to the individual’s circumstances, living environment, and compliance with TB therapy.</p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">The guidelines classify active TB cases into three grades of
        <u>infectiousness</u> and two grades of <u>organism</u> <u>resistance</u>. They recommend appropriate levels of
        <u>housing</u> <u>options</u> and degrees of <u>respiratory</u> <u>isolation</u> for each grade of
        infectiousness and resistance.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph"><u>Infectiousness</u> is graded by AFB smear, TB culture results, clinical improvement in response to
        medical therapy, and evidence of adherence with therapy.</p>
    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>Grades of Infectiousness:</span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
        <ul>
            <li>Grade I: smear
                positive, culture positive</li>
            <li>Grade II: smear
                negative, culture positive or unknown</li>
            <li>Grade III: smear negative,
                culture negative</li>
            <li><i>Smear negative =
                three consecutive negative sputum AFB smears on separate days.</i></li>
            <li><i>Culture negative =
                three consecutive negative AFB cultures one week apart.</i></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">Drug susceptibility or drug resistance is based on the drug susceptibility testing results of the <i>M.
        tuberculosis </i>isolate recovered from the patient. TB isolates are considered fully susceptible if they
        have been shown to be susceptible to all first line anti-TB drugs. Resistant strains are those resistant to one
        or more anti-TB drugs.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        <u>Housing options</u> include the home for patients who can return to a
        stable home and three levels of facilities for those without a stable home.</p>

                Program (smear positive, medi- cally stable and clinical improving)</li>
            <li>Level 2:
                Shelters that require negative smears; trained staff provide DOT, Alternative Housing Program (smear positive,
                medically stable and clinical improving)</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">Per CDC guidelines, use simple surgical masks for patients. Isolation categories apply to patients with clinical improvement in response to medical therapy (e.g., resolution of fever, diminished cough, reduced number of organisms on AFB smear) and evidence of adherence with therapy. DOT is the standard of care for all TB patients in Georgia.</p>

        </li>
        <li>The patient is willing to remain isolated in the home except for healthcare associated visits
            until the patient has negative sputum smear results. Patients who have suspected or confirmed TB disease
            are more likely to have already transmitted TB infection to members of their household before their TB
            disease was diagnosed and treatment was started.
