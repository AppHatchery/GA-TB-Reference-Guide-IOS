            <li> Evaluate for active TB disease both before and during treatment of LTBI.</li>
            <li>Inform the patient or parents or legal guardians about possible adverse effects of the LTBI treatment
                regimen and instruct them to seek prompt medical attention when symptoms of possible adverse reaction first
                appear; particularly
                    drug hypersensitivity reactions, rash, hypotension, or signs
                    of thrombocytopenia (see <a
                            href="table_6_ltbi_treatment_drug_adverse_reactions.html">Table
                        6</a>).
                </li>
                <li>Conduct monthly evaluations to assess treatment adherence
                    and adverse effects, with repeated patient education regarding adverse effects at each visit.
                </li>
                <li>For those on self-administered therapy, never dispense
                    more than one month of therapy (and no refills). Include
                    careful questioning about side effects and a brief physical
                    examination checking for evidence of hepatitis or other side
                    effects during each visit.
                </li>
                <li>Order baseline hepatic chemistry blood tests (AST or ALT)
                    for patients with the following specific conditions: HIV infection, liver disorders, postpartum period (≤ 3
                    months after
                    delivery), regular alcohol use, injection drug use, or use of
                    medications with known possible interactions. (We prefer to
                    obtain a baseline laboratory chemistry profile including a
                    hepatic chemistry blood test on all adult patients starting
                    LTBI therapy.)
                </li>
                <li>In the absence of liver disease or HIV infection, children on
                    LTBI therapy do not need monthly ALT or AST monitoring.
                </li>
                <li>Conduct blood tests at subsequent clinical encounters for
                    patients whose baseline testing is abnormal and for others at
                    risk for liver disease. Discontinue the LTBI treatment regimen if a serum AST concentration is ≥ 5 times the
                    upper
                    limit of normal in the absence of symptoms or ≥ 3 times the
                    upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>In case of a possible severe adverse reaction, discontinue
                    the LTBI regimen immediately and provide supportive medical care. Conservative management and continuation
                    of LTBI
                    therapy under observation can be considered in the presence of mild to moderate adverse events as determined
                    by
                    the health care provider.

    <p class="uk-paragraph"><span class="uk-text-bold"><i>Pyridoxine</i></span> (Vitamin B6) should be used (25-50 mg/day) with INH for persons with conditions in
         which neuropathy is common (e.g., HIV, diabetes, alcohol use disorder, malnutrition) as well as pregnant women and persons with a seizure disorder to
          prevent INH-associated neuropathy. Pyridoxine should be given to all persons living with HIV, all children, and women who are breastfeeding. For healthy 
          individuals on a normal diet, pyridoxine is optional. However, we prefer to give pyridoxine to all patients on INH. Pyridoxine (at 25 mg per day) is also recommended for children on INH.</p>
