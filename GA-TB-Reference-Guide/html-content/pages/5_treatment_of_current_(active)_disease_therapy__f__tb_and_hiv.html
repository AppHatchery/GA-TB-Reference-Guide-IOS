            Treatment of persons living with HIV with active TB disease should be carried out in consultation with a
            physician who has experience in the use of rifamycin drugs and antiretroviral agents.
            Recommendations on the treatment of TB in combination with antiretroviral therapy continue to evolve, and it
            is important to check for updated guidelines:

                    Improves outcomes for persons living with HIV and decreases HIV-related mortality as well as risk of
                    relapse. Persons living with HIV in the United States with active TB disease commonly have advanced
                    HIV/AIDS with low CD4 counts and high plasma HIV RNA levels; all patients with TB who have HIV
                    co-infection should receive treatment for HIV with ART.

                    Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of ART initiation among persons living with HIV

                <li>
                    However, the use of ART among persons living with HIV with active TB disease is complicated by
                    overlapping toxicity profiles of some antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs; complex drug-drug
                    interactions; and the occurrence of “paradoxical” reactions or immune reconstitution inflammatory

            As noted above, there are certain situations where ART therapy should be delayed when treating persons with
            active TB disease who have HIV co-infection. A study of people living with HIV with TB meningitis found that
            early ART was associated with an increase in severe adverse events and no mortality benefit. Thus, timing of
            ART initiation in persons with active TB disease who have HIV co-infection should take into account both the
            degree of immune suppression and site of disease (see Table 16 and recommendations above).

                    Rifampin is a potent inducer of the CYP3A, while rifabutin is a less potent inducer. Rifampin cannot
                    be given with most protease inhibitors because it results in low serum levels of these drugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rifabutin has less of an effect and therefore can be used with certain protease inhibitors as

            The protease inhibitors also affect rifamycin metabolism and because the rifamycin metabolism is retarded by
            these drugs, the dose of rifabutin needs to be reduced in order to avoid rifabutin related toxicity.

            Despite these drug-drug interactions, a rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin) should ALWAYS be included in the

            <p>*Preliminary data suggest that there is an increased risk of neural tube defects in infants born to women
                who were receiving DTG at the time of conception. DTG is contraindicated for pregnant women during first
                trimester and for women who are planning to become pregnant or are not using effective contraception.
                DTG is the preferred integrase inhibitor after first trimester.</p>
