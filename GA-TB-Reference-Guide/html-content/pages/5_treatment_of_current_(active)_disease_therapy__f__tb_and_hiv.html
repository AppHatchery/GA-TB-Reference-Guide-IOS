            Treatment of persons living with HIV with active TB disease should be carried out in consultation with a
            physician who has experience in the use of rifamycin drugs and antiretroviral agents.
            Recommendations on the treatment of TB in combination with antiretroviral therapy continue to evolve, and it
            is important to check for updated guidelines:

                    Improves outcomes for persons living with HIV and decreases HIV-related mortality as well as risk of
                    relapse. Persons living with HIV in the United States with active TB disease commonly have advanced
                    HIV/AIDS with low CD4 counts and high plasma HIV RNA levels; all patients with TB who have HIV
                    co-infection should receive treatment for HIV with ART.

                    Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefits of ART initiation among persons living with HIV
                    during TB treatment, including a reduction in mortality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, the use of ART among persons living with HIV with active TB disease is complicated by
                    overlapping toxicity profiles of some antituberculosis and antiretroviral drugs; complex drug-drug
                    interactions; and the occurrence of “paradoxical” reactions or immune reconstitution inflammatory
                    syndrome (IRIS).

                    initiating ART as soon as possible, but within 2 weeks of starting TB treatment.

                <li>
                    <b>During pregnancy, regardless of CD4 count:</b> Initiate ART as early as feasible for treatment of
                    the person with HIV and prevention of HIV transmission to the infant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>With TB meningitis:</b> Initiate ART after TB meningitis is under control and after at least 2
                    weeks of anti-TB treatment to reduce the risk of life-threatening inflammation in a closed space
                    (i.e., brain) as a result of immune reconstitution. Generally, initiation of ART in this setting is
                    recommended 4 to 8 weeks after initiation of therapy for TB meningitis.

        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            As noted above, there are certain situations where ART therapy should be delayed when treating persons with
            active TB disease who have HIV co-infection. A study of people living with HIV with TB meningitis found that
            early ART was associated with an increase in severe adverse events and no mortality benefit. Thus, timing of
            ART initiation in persons with active TB disease who have HIV co-infection should take into account both the
            degree of immune suppression and site of disease (see Table 16 and recommendations above).

                    Because of the potential for significant drug interactions and overlapping toxicities, the choice of
                    ART among persons living with HIV who have active TB disease should be made only after direct
                    communication between HIV and tuberculosis care providers.

                <li>
                    Any change in either the TB medications or the ART regimen should be immediately shared between the

        <p class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)">There are clinically important drug-drug interactions between
            the rifamycins (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentene) and some of the antiretroviral drugs, especially
            integrase and protease inhibitors.<span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></p>
        <div class="item">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The rifamycins are inducers of the cytochrome P450-3A (CYP3A) system in the liver and thereby
                    decrease serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by this system including integrase and protease
                    inhibitors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rifampin is a potent inducer of the CYP3A, while rifabutin is a less potent inducer. Rifampin cannot
                    be given with most protease inhibitors because it results in low serum levels of these drugs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rifabutin has less of an effect and therefore can be used with certain protease inhibitors as
                    described below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rifampin and rifabutin can be given with certain integrase inhibitors (<a

        </div>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            The protease inhibitors also affect rifamycin metabolism and because the rifamycin metabolism is retarded by
            these drugs, the dose of rifabutin needs to be reduced in order to avoid rifabutin related toxicity.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            Despite these drug-drug interactions, a rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin) should ALWAYS be included in the
            treatment regimen for drug-susceptible TB among persons living with HIV.
