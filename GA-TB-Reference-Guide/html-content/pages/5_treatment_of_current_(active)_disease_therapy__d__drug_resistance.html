        Seek expert consultation for all patients with suspected or proven drug-resistant TB. Treatment of active TB disease caused by drug- resistant organisms should be done by or in close consultation with an expert in the management of these difficult situations.
    </p> 

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        INH-resistant TB is the most common form of drug-resistant TB (with a global prevalence of >10%). Updated ATS/CDC/ IDSA recommendations for the treatment of drug-resistant TB recommend the addition of later generation fluoroquinolones (i.e., levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) to rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the treatment of INH-resistant TB, although there are limited data on the benefit of the addition of the fluoroquinolone in these circumstances.
    </p>
        
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        Multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB is defined as resistance to at least INH and rifampin. New and repurposed anti-TB drugs included in treatment regimens have provided new options for the treatment of MDR-TB including 6-9 month regimens using BPaL (bedaquiline, pretomanid, and levofloxacin) or BPaLM (BPaL plus moxifloxacin).
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        As
        noted, consultation with an expert is required for MDR-TB and other drug-resistant TB cases. Second line
        treatment
        regimens often represent the patient’s last best hope for being cured. Inappropriate management can have
        life-threatening consequences.</p>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">
            If you think, identify, or suspect rifampin-resistant or MDR-TB disease in a person with TB, contact the state consultants by direct email, Dr. Susan Ray <a href="mailto:sray02@emory.edu">sray02@emory.edu</a> or Dr. Marcos Schechter <a href="mailto:mcoutin@emory.edu">mcoutin@emory.edu</a>, or by telephoning the Georgia Department of Public Health TB Program at 404-657-2597 for diagnostic and treatment support. There are multiple strategies to pursue rapid genotypic assessment for drug resistance.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-paragraph">Additionally, there are 
        several exciting new regimens with strong outcomes that require expert consultation.
        See <a href="15_appendix_district_tb_coordinators_(by_district).html">Appendix</a> and/or website for making contact with an appropriate expert in
        your
        county:<a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors">https://dph.georgia.gov/district-health-directors</a>
