            <div class="item">
            Rifampin for 4 months is a preferred CDC treatment regimen for the treatment of LTBI among persons presumed to be infected with drug-susceptible TB (isoniazid [INH] and rifampin susceptible) and is the regimen of choice for the treatment of LTBI among persons thought to be infected with INH-resistant strains 
            of M. tuberculosis. Rifampin is also preferred by many clinicians and public health clinics because of the shorter duration of therapy compared to INH and because rifampin has less hepatotoxicity compared to INH for the treatment of LTBI.

            Rifampin for 4 months has been shown to be noninferior to 9 months of INH for the treatment of LTBI in a randomized controlled trial. In addition, rifampin was associated with higher completion rates and fewer adverse effects compared to INH. Rifampin has a large number of drug -drug interactions (as discussed on page 78) 
            including warfarin, oral contraceptives, azole antifungals, and HIV antiretroviral therapy. Other medications that a person with LTBI is taking is an important consideration when determining whether rifampin or other LTBI regimens which include rifampin or other rifamycins can be prescribed. Drug-drug interactions between
             rifamycins and antiretroviral therapy are regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
               (for LTBI regimens and rifampin/rifamycins: <a href="https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infections/mycobacterium">https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/guidelines/hiv-clinical-guidelines-adult-and-adolescent-opportunistic-infections/mycobacterium</a> );

            <div class="item">
                <p>A short course regimen of weekly INH plus rifapentine for 12 weekly doses is another CDC-preferred
                     regimen for the treatment of LTBI (due to presumed infection with drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis) in adults as well as children > 2 years of age.
                      In 2011, when CDC first recommended 3HP for the treatment of LTBI it indicated it should be delivered by directly observed therapy [DOT]. However, based on further studies and updated data, CDC revised guidelines for the use of 3HP in 2018 expanded the patient populations for which this regimen could be used and included an option for self-administration of the 3HP regimen. CDC recommendations for 3HP in the treatment of LTBI include:</p>
                    <ul class="uk-list uk-list-disc">
                        <li>use of 3HP in adults and persons aged 2–17 years with
                            LTBI;
                        </li>
                        <li>use of 3HP in persons who are living with HIV with

                            adolescents indicate that rifapentine as part of a 3HP regimen is acceptable to use among persons 
                            living with HIV on and ART regimen that includes once daily dolutegravir]; and

                        <li>
                            use of 3HP by directly observed therapy (DOT) or self-administered 
                            therapy (SAT) in persons aged ≥ 2
                            years. Per CDC recommendations, “the health care
                            provider should choose the mode of administration
                            (DOT versus SAT) based on local practice, individual
                            patient attributes and preferences, and other considerations, including risk for progression to
                            severe
                            forms of TB disease” (MMWR 2018; 67:723-72).
        
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                       The 3HP is regimen is NOT recommended for pregnant women, children < 2 years old, persons living with HIV who are on antiretroviral
                        drugs that have significant drug-drug interactions with rifapentine, or patients infected with suspected INH-resistant,
                         rifampin-resistant, or multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. Other potential challenges in using the 3HP regimen in addition to
                          the drug-drug interactions due to rifapentine (similar to those seen with other rifamycin drugs such as rifampin) include cost of 
                          medications that are greater than most alternatives; the need to take numerous pills simultaneously (10 pills once weekly
                           compared with two or three pills daily for other regimens for most adults); and the association with a systemic drug
                            reaction or influenza-like syndrome that can include syncope and hypotension (although the risk of hospitalization is low, 0.1% in published studies).

                <p>
                   In the CDC 2020 LTBI treatment guidelines, 6 or 9 months of daily INH is a recommended alternative regimen for the treatment of 
                   LTBI (due to presumed infection with drug susceptible M. tuberculosis) as shown in <a href="#table4">Table 4</a>. A regimen of 6 months of daily INH
                    is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults and children of all ages and conditionally recommended for adults living with 
                    HIV and children of all ages; INH daily for 9 months is conditionally recommended for adults and children of all ages, both 
                    HIV-seronegative and HIV-positive. One practical approach for the use of INH for LTBI is to aim for a 9 month regimen with the 
                    goal of completion of at least 6 months. INH can be given daily (e.g., by self-administered therapy) as outlined in <a href="#table5">Table 5</a>. 
                    INH should be used for the treatment of LTBI when there are serious potential drug-drug interactions with rifampin or other rifamycins.

            discussed above for rifampin).

        * Isoniazid is formulated as 100-mg and 300-mg tablets. † Rifapentine is formulated as 150-mg tablets in blister packs that should be kept sealed until use. Rifapentine should not be used for children &lt2 years of age due to lack of pharmacokinetic data.¶ Rifampin (rifampicin) is formulated as 150-mg and 300-mg capsules.   ** The American Academy of Pediatrics acknowledges that some experts use rifampin at 20 - 30 mg/kg for the daily regimen when prescribing for infants and toddlers.

        <i>* Hypersensitivity reaction to rifamycins (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine): reactions may include a flu-like syndrome (e.g. fever, chills, headaches, dizziness, musculoskeletal pain), thrombocytopenia, shortness of breath or other signs and symptoms including wheezing, acute bronchospasm, urticaria, petechiae, purpura, pruritus, conjunctivitis, angioedema, hypotension or shock. If moderate to severe reaction (e.g. thrombocytopenia, hypotension), hospitalization or life-threatening event: Discontinue treatment. If mild reaction (e.g. rash, dizziness, fever): Continue to monitor patient closely with a low threshold for discontinuing treatment. A flu-like syndrome appears to be the most common side effect profile leading to discontinuation of the 3HP regimen. Rifabutin can rarely cause uveitis.</i>
