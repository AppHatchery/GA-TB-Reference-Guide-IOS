                    <b>Any patient who is started on treatment for suspected or proven active TB disease (even while still in the hospital) should be reported to local public health authorities at the time treatment is started.</b>
                    <li>Therapy consists of an initiation phase and a continuation phase.</li>
                    <li>The initiation phase for presumed on confirmed drug-susceptible active TB disease generally consists of a 4-drug regimen given daily or 5 times per week per DOT. An option for twice weekly therapy by DOT after the initial 2 weeks of daily therapy (“Denver regimen”) is not recommended by the Georgia TB Program for any persons diagnosed with active TB disease and should never be used for persons living with HIV infection, cavitary pulmonary TB, disseminated TB, vertebral TB or for patients who have co-morbid medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, or liver disease.</li>
                    <li>The initiation phase is followed by a continuation phase. For drug susceptible disease, this can consist
                        of
                        daily, 5 times per week or thrice weekly by DOT (see <a href="table_7_recommended_regimens_for_treatment_of_adults_and_children_with_drug_susceptible_tb_pulmonary_tb.html">Table 7 </a>). For patients with HIV co-infection, in
                        the
                        continuation phase, twice weekly therapy is contraindicated because of increased risk of relapse with
                        rifampin-resistant disease; in such cases therapy should be given daily (or 5 times per week) or thrice
                        weekly by DOT. In general, daily therapy is preferred throughout for patients with HIV co-infection or
                        other
                        immune-compromising conditions. See <a href="fig1_factors_to_be_considered.html">Figure 1</a>.</li>

        <li>For patients with pulmonary TB, sputum specimens should be obtained at a minimum on a monthly basis until two consecutive specimens are culture negative (some obtain monthly specimens throughout the course of therapy). As discussed above, the 2-month culture is a critical data-point.
        </li>

        <li>Twice-weekly therapy is not recommended for use in the continuation phase by us and is contraindicated for
            treat- ment of persons living with HIV.
        </li>


        <li>Rifampin (RIF) has many drug-drug interactions and may accelerate clearance of drugs metabolized by the liver
            including methadone, coumadin, glucocorticoids, estrogens, oral hypoglycemic agents, anticonvulsants,
            fluconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, cyclosporin, and protease inhibitors. Rifabutin can be used as a
            first
            line drug in place of rifampin for patients who are receiving medications, especially antiretroviral drugs,
            that
            have unacceptable interactions with rifampin.
            <ul>
                <li>Women taking RIF (or rifabutin) should use a barrier birth control method (and not rely on hormone
                    contraceptives alone).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Dose-counting: Although TB treatment regimens are generally described in terms of “months” of treatment, it
            is
            important that each patient receives an adequate number of doses. Thus, treatment completion is defined by
            number of doses actually taken as well as duration of treatment. The number of doses required for each
            regimen
            is listed in <a href="table_7_recommended_regimens_for_treatment_of_adults_and_children_with_drug_susceptible_tb_pulmonary_tb.html">Table 7 </a>.
        </li>
        <li>Follow-up after completion of therapy is generally not needed for patients who have had a satisfactory and prompt bacteriologic response and who have completed observed therapy with a 6- or 9-month INH- and RIF-containing regimen for drug-susceptible TB. Patients should be informed to seek prompt medical evaluation if symptoms reappear.</li>

            <li>Daily intake of alcohol increases the risk of hepatitis among patients taking INH.</li>
            <li>Never add a single drug to a failing regimen.</li>
            <li><strong>Directly observed therapy (DOT) is the standard of care for administering treatment of active TB disease, and such treatment should be supervised and coordinated by the local health department. </strong>For
                any patient on self-administered therapy, dispense only a 1-month supply of medicine at a time.

            <li>
                A 4-month treatment regimen of rifapentine, moxifloxacin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide was found to be non-inferior compared to the standard 6-month TB treatment regimen for active drug-susceptible pulmonary TB (N Engl J Med 2021; 384:1705-1718).
            </li>
            <li>
                This study provides evidence that in the future it may be possible to use shorter TB treatment regimens.
            </li>
            <li>
                This 4-month regimen is <strong>not</strong> currently recommended by the Georgia Department of Public Health TB Program.
            </li>
            <li>
                CDC has released interim guidelines on the use of this new 4-month regimen <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7108a1">(http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7108a1)</a>; further infrastructure development for fluoroquinolone susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis isolates is also needed to implement this new treatment regimen in Georgia and other communities in the U.S.
