        To reduce the spread of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB, CureTB connects people with TB to healthcare services 
        as they move between the United States and other countries.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph"> 
        Health departments, healthcare providers, and others can refer patients to CureTB for assistance with accessing ongoing 
        TB care abroad. CureTB can also help health officials and providers locate TB treatment health records for their patients in different countries.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Refer early.</b> Let a CureTB referral manager speak to your patient before they leave the United States. This will help us establish rapport, clarify CureTB's role, and get accurate locating information abroad.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Provide complete information.</b> Attach laboratory, clinical, and treatment information to your referral. This will help us provide the receiving provider with complete information about the patient. Provide updates if important clinical information is pending at the time of referral (e.g., drug susceptibility testing results).

            <li>
                <b>Identify reliable contacts.</b> Ask your patient to provide contact information (e.g., phone, address, e-mail) for at least two people who will always know where they can be found. We will also review this information with your patient(s).

        Health department staff are trained and experienced in contact investigation, provision of directly observed treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) 
        and directly observed therapy (DOT) for the treatment of patients with active disease. Physicians with expertise in treating TB are part of the health
         department team in each county. DOT is the standard of care for all patients with TB disease in Georgia and is strongly recommended for all patients
          with tuberculosis to facilitate adherence and completion of therapy.
     </p>
     <p class="uk-paragraph">
        Early reporting of suspected or confirmed TB cases is important for control of TB and <u>is required by law</u>. Reporting gives the clinician
         access to the resources of the public health department for assistance in case management and contact investigation and consultation with expert
          TB clinicians. Contact investigations are indicated to determine those who have been exposed to infectious TB patients so close contacts can be
           evaluated for evidence of active or latent TB and treatment provided as indicated.
     </p>
     <p>
        Tuberculosis services (radiology, medical consultations, DOT, etc.) are available in every health district. All TB medications are provided by the state pharmacy free of charge.
     </p>
    
     <p class="uk-paragraph">
        For TB control efforts, it is important that there be a smooth transition from the in-patient to the outpatient setting and close cooperation and
         coordination of activities among the wide variety of organizations involved in TB patient care, education and TB control.
