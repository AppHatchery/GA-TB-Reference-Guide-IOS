    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        In general, the risk of occupational acquisition of TB is low among the large majority of US health care workers
        (HCWs) given the changing epidemiology of the disease in the U.S. </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        The risk of TB exposure among most US-based health care workers (HCWs) is similar to the general population given the decreased TB incidence and improved hospital infection prevention and control measures in the U.S.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">Given the low risk among the vast majority of US HCWs, serial TB testing for US-based HCWs has been associated with a high rate of false-positive conversions. Therefore, CDC guidelines were updated in 2019 and no longer recommend routine serial testing for most US-based HCWs [MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2019;68:439–44.]. Guidelines continue to recommend baseline screening and testing in addition to an individual TB risk assessment to aid in LTBI diagnostic test interpretation.</p>

    <!-- Insert Image -->
    <img src="image_1.png" alt="Figure 10-1">

    <p class="uk-paragraph">All HCWs should have baseline test for LTBI (unless documented to be previously TST or IGRA positive or documented to have had prior TB disease). If the TST is used, two-step tuberculin skin testing upon employment is recommended unless the HCW had a TST in the prior year.</p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">Updated guidelines suggest health care facilities may consider serial testing in selected situations, such professionals at increased risk for exposure or selected areas in the facility where transmission has occurred and/or infection control lapses occur and infectious patients were present.</p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        If serial testing of HCWs is needed, we recommend the use of the TST rather than an IGRA because of high rates of false positive IGRA tests when serial testing of low risk US health care workers was performed as described above (see pages 19—21 ).
    </p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        Following a TB exposure from a patient with infectious TB not in Airborne Infection Isolation Precautions, HCWs should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of TB. Those with a negative baseline test and no prior LTBI or TB should have a TST (or IGRA) performed. If the test is negative, a repeat test 8-10 weeks after the last exposure is recommended.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        Any worker who develops symptoms of active TB disease or whose test for LTBI (TST or IGRA) converts to positive
        should be evaluated promptly. Health care workers with recent TB infection on the basis of a conversion to a
        positive test for LTBI (regardless of age) and no evidence of active disease should be encouraged to take
        treatment for LTBI (see <a href="3_treatment_of_latent_tb_infection_(ltbi).html"> Treatment for LTBI</a>).</p>
