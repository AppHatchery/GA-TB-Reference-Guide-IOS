    <p class="uk-paragraph"> The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) TB program has a contract with the American Lung Association of Georgia (ALAG) to provide alternative housing and basic necessities (meals, personal supplies, transportation, and social services) for patients without these resources.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph"> Hundreds of TB patients have utilized the Alternative Housing Program since 1996. The Program utilizes inexpensive motels, trailers, duplexes, apartments and houses. The Health Departments provide directly observed therapy (DOT) for treatment of active TB disease and transportation to TB and Ryan White clinic appointments.</p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">The plan to place persons with TB who are experiencing homelessness in area housing requires frequent communication among ALAG area hospitals and county TB Clinics. In addition to the formal agreements between ALAG and rental establishments, letters of agreements are on file from all participating districts. These letters demonstrate a commitment to the Alternative Housing Program by each District TB Program. Monthly patient care reviews are mandatory to ensure that continuity of care is maintained, and other needed services are being provided. A designated Outreach Worker provides DOT and patient follow-up.</p>
