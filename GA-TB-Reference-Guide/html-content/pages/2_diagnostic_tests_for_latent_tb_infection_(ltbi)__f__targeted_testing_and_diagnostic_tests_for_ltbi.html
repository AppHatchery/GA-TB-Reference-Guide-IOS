    <ul>

    testing populations that are at increased risk for TB infection

    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    This is a “B” recommendation (“offer or provide this
    service”) indicating that given the current evidence, the USPSTF
    has concluded with moderate certainty that benefits of screening
    for LTBI in people who are at increased risk of infection outweigh
    the potential harms.</li>

    <li>
        However, the highest-risk populations and thus those with the greatest benefit for targeted screening and treatment (persons living with HIV, close contacts of persons with active TB, and those being treated with immunosuppressive
        agents such as TNF-α inhibitors) were excluded from the USPSTF
        review of evidence because “screening in these populations may
        be considered standard care as part of disease management or
        indicated prior to the use of certain medications.”
    </li>

    <li>
        Once these highest-risk groups which should be screened for LTBI are removed, patients considered high risk in the primary
        care setting that should be screened for LTBI include non-U.S. born persons
        who have immigrated to the U.S. from high burden TB countries.

        <p class="uk-paragraph"><b>Testing of low risk individuals for LTBI is discouraged</b> because
            false-positive results are more likely to occur in this setting. Because QFT, TSPOT, and TST each measure
            different aspects of the immune response and use different antigens and interpretation criteria, test
            results might not be interchangeable. Different
            tests can yield different results. Studies which employed multiple
            diagnostic tests have demonstrated that discordant test results

                    "conversion" (e.g., up
                    to 10-fold higher than the TST) when IGRAs were used for
                    serial testing of health care workers in low-risk/lowprevalence situations in the U.S. and Canada (thus
                    suggesting the IGRA results were false positive). Most health care
