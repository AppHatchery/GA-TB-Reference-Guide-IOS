        Based on data from two randomized controlled trials (prior to the publications of these studies), the World Health Organization (WHO) published updated recommendations
         in September 2024 on preventive treatment among contacts exposed to multidrug- or rifampin-resistant TB <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240096196"> (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240096196)</a>.
          These studies include TB-CHAMP carried out in South Africa and VQUIN carried out in Vietnam. Treatment with 6 months of daily levofloxacin is now recommended by WHO 
          for those with LTBI who were exposed to a drug resistant TB case. In December 2024, the TB-CHAMP and VQUIN studies were published in the New England Journal of 
          Medicine (391:2315-2326 and 391:2304-2314). In both studies, preventive treatment with levofloxacin led to a lower incidence of TB than placebo among those who were contacts to MDR-TB index cases but the differences did not reach statistical significance. In a meta-analysis which included 
          both the TB-CHAMP and VQUIN studies (NEJM Evid. 2025; 4:EVIDoa2400190), levofloxacin use for preventive therapy was associated with a 60% relative reduction in 
          TB incidence among adult and child household MDR-TB contacts, but with an increased risk of musculoskeletal adverse events. <b>A TB specialist should 
          be consulted in the management of contacts to rifampin-resistant and MDR-TB cases</b>.

    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        In deciding how to treat persons with LTBI which may be due to infection with a rifampin-resistant or MDR-TB strain, the following four questions should be considered.
    </p>

    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>How likely is it that a patient is newly TB infected?</span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
        <p>A patient with a documented positive prior TST (or another diagnostic
            test such as an IGRA) is much less likely to be newly infected.</p>
    </div>

    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>How likely is it that the patient is infected with an MDR-TB
        strain?</span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
            <p>An infant with a positive diagnostic test for LTBI
                (TST or IGRA) whose parent has active MDR-TB is highly
                likely to be infected with MDR-TB. In contrast, a health care
                worker with a positive TST and no known source case may
                have a low probability of being MDR-TB infected.</p>
        </div>

    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>How likely is the patient to develop active TB?</span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
        <p>Those at highest risk include persons living with HIV
            or otherwise immunocompromised and children < 2 years of age.</p>
    </div>

    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>What is the drug-susceptibility pattern of the source patient’s isolate?</span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
        <p>
            Treatment of LTBI should be tailored to the susceptibility pattern of the source patient’s isolate. When the source patient is known to have isoniazid-resistant TB, 
            rifampin may be used for treatment of LTBI. For those with MDR-TB or rifampin resistant TB with fluoroquinolone susceptibility, levofloxacin for 6 months is now included 
            in WHO guidelines. <i>Again, a TB specialist should be consulted for the management and treatment of LTBI when an individual is thought to be infected with a rifampin-resistant or MDR strain.</i>
