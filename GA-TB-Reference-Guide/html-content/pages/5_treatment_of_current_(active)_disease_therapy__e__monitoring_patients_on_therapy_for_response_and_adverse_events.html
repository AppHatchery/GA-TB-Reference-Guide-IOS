                        For patients with pulmonary TB, obtain sputum for AFB smear and culture at least monthly until two consecutive sputum samples are culture negative. Some authorities prefer to obtain monthly AFB sputum smear and cultures throughout the course of therapy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Patients with cavitary pulmonary TB who have a positive 2-month sputum culture are at increased risk for relapse if treated with only 6 months of therapy for drug-susceptible TB. If the 2-month culture remains positive or if symptoms do not resolve, request repeat drug susceptibility testing to evaluate for acquired drug resistance. Additionally, review information

related to treatment adherence. For any patient receiving self-administered therapy (this should be very rare as DOT is our standard of care) who has a positive 2-month culture, DOT should be initiated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For patients with drug-susceptible active TB disease who have positive 2-month culture and have cavitary disease on their initial CXR, the continuation phase should be increased to 7 months so that they receive a total of 9 months of therapy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Factors to be considered in deciding whether to prolong treatment in patients with either cavitation on
                        initial CXR or a positive culture after 2 months of therapy (but not both) include being more than 10%
                        underweight at diagnosis, having HIV infection or having extensive involvement on CXR.
                    </li>
                    <li>HIV testing should be performed on all persons diagnosed with TB.</li>

                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Obtain the following baseline measurements to detect any abnormality that would complicate the regimen
                        or necessitate its modification:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hepatic enzyme (e.g., AST) level, bilirubin, serum creatinine, complete blood count and platelet count.</li>
                            <li>Baseline visual acuity (if EMB is used)</li>
                            <li>Baseline audiometry (if Amikacin is used).</li>
                            <li>CD4 count and HIV viral load for patients with HIV infection.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Patients with epidemiologic risk factors for hepatitis B or C (e.g., injection drug use, birth in Asia
                        or Africa, HIV infection) should have serologic tests for these viruses performed.
                    </li>
                    <li>All patients should be seen at least monthly and questioned about potential adverse reactions. If
                        symptoms suggesting drug toxicity occur, appropriate laboratory testing should be performed to confirm or exclude
                        such toxicity. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of hepatitis (which can be induced by
                        INH, RIF and/or PZA) immediately. Such symptoms include nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (dark
                        urine, yellow skin), malaise, unexplained fever for &gt; 3 days, or abdominal tenderness. If patients have
                        jaundice or symptoms of liver disease, discontinue medications immediately and consult a specialist.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Routine monthly laboratory monitoring is generally not required for those with normal baseline and no underlying disease. Monitor hepatic enzymes monthly if baseline levels are elevated, and for those with HIV infection, history of alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, concomitant use of other drugs which can cause hepatotoxicity, or pregnancy. At least 20% of patients will have elevated hepatic enzymes; asymptomatic elevation less than five times the upper limit of normal is not an indication to stop treatment in asymptomatic patients. If patients have jaundice or symptomatic liver disease, discontinue medications immediately and consult a specialist.
                    </li>
                    <li>Patients receiving EMB should be questioned regarding visual disturbances at monthly intervals; monthly
                        repeat testing of visual acuity and color vision is recommended for patients receiving an EMB dose
                        exceeding 15—20 mg/ kg (recommended range) and for patients receiving EMB for more than two months.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pyridoxine will usually prevent INH-induced neurotoxicity (peripheral neuropathy) and is recommended for all patients on INH.</li>
                    <li>Hyperuricemia may occur in patients on PZA but acute gout is uncommon. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not
                        an indication for discontinuing the drug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
