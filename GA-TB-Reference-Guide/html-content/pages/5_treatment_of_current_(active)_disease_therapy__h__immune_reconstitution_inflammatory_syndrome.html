    <p class="uk-paragraph">The temporary exacerbation of TB symptoms and lesions after initiation of antituberculosis therapy—known as a
        paradoxical reaction or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) —has been described as a rare
        occurrence
        in HIV-negative patients after the initiation of antituberculosis therapy. 
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
        These “paradoxical reactions” are thought to be due to immune reconstitution and can occur among persons living with
         HIV who are started on antiretroviral therapy early in the course of antituberculosis therapy. Features of IRIS include 
         fever, recurrent symptoms, lymphadentitis, and worsening pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">
       After initial clinical improvement, paradoxical worsening of disease (or IRIS) developed in up to 18 of patients (range 4 to 54%)
        in a pooled estimate derived from 40 observational studies (Ultman OA et al, Ann Intern Med 2015; 10:1077-99). TB-associated IRIS is 
        associated with significant morbidity and even mortality; up to 25% of patients with this syndrome are hospitalized.</p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">Paradoxical or immune reconstitution manifestations depend on anatomical site of disease (e.g., headache in
        patient
        with meningeal TB). Additionally, IRIS can occur in an anatomical site of known disease and/or anatomical
        sites
        not previously known to be involved (e.g., lymph node suppuration in patient without previous adenopathy), a
        process known as “unmasking”. </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">Of note, patients with HIV can have > 1 opportunistic infection and unmasking reactions
        can
        occur that are from previously unsuspected infections (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis). The paradoxical reactions
        are
        associated with increased reactivity on tuberculin skin testing and a significant reduction in HIV viral
        load.</p>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">IRIS may be self-limited and can last 10 to 40 days. Mild to moderate reactions can be managed by reassurance and
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Severe reactions included those characterized by marked increase in
        adenopathy
        causing an anatomic problem (e.g., compromised breathing, swallowing or movement of the neck, or expanding
        central
        nervous system lesions) can be managed with corticosteroids (with continuation of the anti-tuberculosis therapy
        and
        ART) starting at a dose of prednisone at 1.25—1.5 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks and then tapering the therapy over a
        period of 6 to 12 weeks (or longer).</p>

        <P class="uk-paragraph">
            A randomized controlled trial of prednisone (1.5 mg/kg per day for two weeks and then 0.75 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks) vs placebo for persons with HIV and active TB disease who developed moderate to severe IRIS (persons with life threatening IRIS were excluded)

demonstrated that prednisone reduced the need (or duration) of hospitalization and facilitated improvements in symptoms, performance and quality of life (Meintjes G et al. AIDS 2010; 24:2381-90).
        </P>

    <p class="uk-paragraph">For persons living with HIV with active TB disease and at high risk for developing TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS), pre-emptive prednisone is now recommended as adjunctive therapy with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
        (Meintjes G et al. New Engl J Med 2018; 379:1915-25).
        
        </p>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">“High-risk” for IRIS is defined as CD4 count ≤ 100 cells/mm3 and
        starting ART within 30 days of initiating treatment for active TB. The prednisone regimen consists of 40 mg
        daily
        for 2 weeks followed by 20 mg daily for 2 weeks. Preemptive prednisone therapy for IRIS prevention should NOT be
        offered to patients with active hepatitis B infection, Kaposi sarcoma, rifampin-resistant TB, or with poor
        response
        to TB treatment.</p>
