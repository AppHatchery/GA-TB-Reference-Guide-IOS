        active TB. This includes evaluation for TB-related symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, weight loss), physical exam, and a chest 
        radiograph (a lead apron should cover the entire abdomen during the chest radiograph) regardless of gestational age.</p>
        <p> Some 
        defer the chest radiograph until after the first trimester if the patient has no symptoms. Patients in whom there is a suspicion 
        for active TB disease should be further evaluated as discussed in Section IV. Laboratory Diagnosis of Active Tuberculosis. </p>

        Pregnant patients with active TB disease should be treated without delay as outlined <a href="6_pregnancy_and_tb__b__treatment_of_active_tb_in_pregnancy.html">below</a>. </p>

            <li>Pregnant women diagnosed with LTBI prior to pregnancy and started on treatment for LTBI for an appropriate indication should continue LTBI treatment during pregnancy; 
                the regimen should be modified if necessary (e.g., 3HP is not recommended during pregnancy for the treatment of LTBI because of lack of data on its use in this setting).</li>
            <li>For many persons who are pregnant, not severely immunocompromised, and have LTBI, delay of treatment of LTBI until three months after delivery is recommended as discussed below. </li>

    <h4><b>Persons living with HIV who are pregnant.</b></h4>
    
    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>The management of LTBI among pregnant women living with HIV depends on whether there was recent exposure to a patient with untreated active TB,

    <div class="item">
        <ul>
            <li>Recent Exposure/LTBI. Treatment is recommended for all persons living with HIV (regardless of CD4 count) diagnosed with LTBI who are pregnant with recent exposure to a patient with 
                untreated active respiratory TB given the increased risk of progression to active TB in such cases. </li>
            <li>Persons living with HIV not on antiretroviral therapy. Treatment of LTBI is recommend for those who are pregnant and living with HIV if they are not on antiretroviral therapy. 
                Antiretroviral therapy should be started in this group. </li>
            <li>For pregnant women living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy with CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm3, LTBI treatment during pregnancy is recommended given increased risk of progression 
                to active TB. The CD4 cutoff for LTBI therapy is somewhat controversial; some experts favor a lower threshold (e.g., CD4 count ≤200 cells/mm3).  </li>
            <li>For those pregnant persons living with HIV with a CD4 count >350 cells/mm3m, LTBI therapy should be deferred until three months after delivery. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <b class="toggle-title" onclick="toggleItem(this)"><span>The recommendation to defer LTBI therapy until three months after delivery is based on the results of a clinical trial (N Engl J Med 2019; 381:1333) demonstrating more frequent adverse 
        pregnancy outcomes among patients in high TB incidence settings treated with isoniazid during pregnancy than among patients treated three months after delivery. </span><span class="chevron-up">⌃</span></b>
    <div class="item">
    <ul>
        <li>The study included 
        956 pregnant women living with HIV (CD4 count 351 to 670 cells/mm3 on antiretroviral thearpy) randomly assigned to initiate LTBI treatment with isoniazid immediately or defer 
        treatment until 12 weeks after delivery.</li>
        
        <li>Study subjects were excluded if in the first trimester of pregnancy or if they had recent TB exposure; mothers and infants were followed 
        for 48 weeks after delivery. </li>
        <li>The incidence of TB was comparable between the groups (0.60 versus 0.59 per 100 person-years).</li>

        <li>However, the composite adverse pregnancy outcome 
        (stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, preterm delivery, or congenital anomalies) was more commonly seen among those in the immediate LTBI treatment group compared to 
        the deferred group (23.6% versus 17.0%).</li>
        <li>The rate of hepatotoxicity was similar between the groups (6.2 versus 7.2 percent).</li>

    </div>
    <p class="uk-paragraph">The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guidelines 
        recommend delaying LTBI treatment among pregnant persons living with HIV until three months after delivery in the absence of a recent TB exposure, but do not specify a CD4 threshold.</p>

    <div class="item">
    <ul>
        <li>For any pregnant woman with documented recent LTBI (e.g., exposure to a patient with untreated active pulmonary TB and documented recent infection based on an LTBI 
        diagnostic test) or recent (within two years) conversion of a diagnostic test for TB infection to positive, LTBI treatment is recommended with one of three regimens mentioned below.</li></ul>

    <ul>
        <li>For pregnant women without HIV infection who are not severely immunocompromised and have no recent exposure to a person with untreated active pulmonary (or laryngeal) TB, it is recommended that LTBI treatment be deferred until three months after delivery, to minimize the risk of drug-induced hepatitis (e.g., from isoniazid) and adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with LTBI treatment during pregnancy. In such cases, close follow-up is required.</li>
        <li>For all pregnant persons with LTBI who have therapy deferred until three months after delivery, a follow-up evaluation for active TB disease (including chest radiograph) to confirm that active TB did not develop in the interval since diagnosis of LTBI and the time that treatment for LTBI begins should be carried out.</li></ul>

    <ul><li>
        The same treatment regimens for LTBI that are used in non-pregnant persons can be used in pregnant and postpartum women with the EXCEPTION that 3HP (isoniazid plus rifapentine given weekly x 12 weeks) should NOT be used in pregnant and postpartum women because of lack of data in these settings.  
    </li>
    <li>Options for CDC recommended LTBI regimens in pregnant and postpartum women include rifampin (for four months), isoniazid plus rifampin for 3 months, or isoniazid for 6-9 months. All pregnant persons receiving isoniazid for LTBI should also receive pyridoxine (vitamin B6) 50 mg po daily.</li></ul>
