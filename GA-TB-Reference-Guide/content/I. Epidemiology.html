  <h1>I. Epidemiology</h1>

  <p>Two FDA-approved IGRA tests are commercially available in the U.S. These include the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT) test and the TSPOT.TB (TSPOT) test. Guidelines on the use of these IGRAs as diagnostic tests for LTBI have been published by the American Thoracic Society (ATS), CDC, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [Clin Infect Dis 2017; 64(2):111–5]. IGRAs are in- vitro blood tests that are based on interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release after stimulation by relatively TB-specific antigens (i.e., ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in both assays). The QFT is a whole blood assay that uses an ELISA technique to measure IFN-γ production. TSPOT uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and detects (by use of ELISPOT) the number of T cells producing IFN-γ. Because the antigens used in the IGRAs are not found in M. bovis BCG (or most non-tuberculous mycobacteria), the IGRAs are more specif- ic than the TST when used to test persons who have received BCG vaccination and do not cross react with most non- tuberculous mycobacteria. Criteria on what constitutes a positive IGRA test have been published and are shown in Tables 1 and 2.</p>

  <p>The cut-off points are static, and there are no criteria for what constitutes an IGRA conversion when serial testing is performed. IGRAs can provide a positive, negative, or indeterminate result. Indeterminate results more commonly occur among HIV- seropositive and other immunocompromised persons but can occasionally occur among healthy individuals. If the result of the IGRA test is indeterminate, it is recommended that the test be repeated. The risk of developing active TB after a positive TST result has been defined in large prospective longitudinal studies, but data are more limited for the IGRAs. The IGRAs cost signifi- cantly more per test than the TST but are logistically easier to perform as they only require a single visit. In certain situations or selected populations (e.g., BCG-vaccinated persons), IGRAs may be cost-effective when considering cost of chest radiographs avoided compared to the TST when cross reactions may be seen.</p>
