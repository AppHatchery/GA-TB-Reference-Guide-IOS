  <p>There is no "gold standard" test for latent TB infection (LTBI). Two types of diagnostic tests to detect LTBI are now available. These include the tuberculin skin test (TST) which has been avail- able for > 100 years and a newer generation of diagnostic tests, the interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), which are T-cell-based in - vitro blood tests. Two IGRAs are approved for use by the U.S. FDA. Neither the TST nor IGRA tests can distinguish LTBI from active TB disease.</p>
  
  <h1>A. Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)</h1>

  <p>The tuberculin skin test (TST) measures a delayed-type hyper- sensitivity (DTH) reaction (recruitment of memory T cells to the site of an intradermal injection of purified protein derivative [PPD]). The TST should be carried out using the Mantoux meth- od. Multiple puncture tests (Tine and Heaf) should not be used. Tuberculin skin tests should be administered and read by trained healthcare personnel. The TST is administered by injecting 0.1 ml of 5 tuberculin units (TU) PPD into the dorsal or volar surface of the forearm. The injection is made with a disposable tuberculin syringe, with the needle bevel facing upward and placed just un- der the surface of the skin, so that a discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6 mm to 10 mm in diameter is produced.</p>

  <p>Needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken, re- moved from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. Dispose of needles and syringes in puncture-resistant containers. Follow standard precautions for infection control.</p>
  
  <p>TSTs should be read 48 to 72 hours after administration. If test reading is delayed, a positive reaction may still be measurable up to one week after testing. A test cannot be read as negative if more than 72 hours have passed since it was placed. The transverse diameter of palpable <b>induration</b> should be measured and <b>recorded in millimeters</b>. If no induration is present, record “0 mm.” Do not measure erythema (redness).</p>
  
  <p>Limitations of the TST include cross reactions between TST and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for persons who have been vaccinated with BCG, but an advantage of the IGRAs is that they do not cross react with BCG (see below). A positive TST in a BCG-vaccinated person is assumed to indicate infection with M. tuberculosis when the person tested is at increased risk for recent infection, is from an area with high rates of TB, or has a medical condition that increases the risk for disease (Section II, B).</p>
